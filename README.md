# Cracking the Robotics Engineer Interview: Cheatsheets
The title of this repo is a tribute to the book _Cracking the Coding Interview_, while also referencing the "cheatsheets" mentioned in Joma Tech's "How Programmers Overprepare for Job Interviews" video. There are some of the notes I "overprepared" during my robotics engineer interviews between Sep 2024 and Feb 2025.
